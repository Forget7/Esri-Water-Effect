# Realistic Water Effects

An app that demonstrations realistic water effects with [Esri](https://www.esri.com/)'s [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

Click [here](http://richiecarmichael.github.io/water/index.html) for the live application.

This app is based on the work by [Jesse van den Kieboom](https://github.com/jkieboom) at the 2016 Esri [Developer Summit](http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit). Here are the [slides](http://jkieboom.github.io/devsummit-palm-springs-2016/presentations/arcgis-js-api-3d-advanced-topics/#/27), [live demo](https://jkieboom.github.io/devsummit-palm-springs-2016/demos/apps/external-renderer/) and [source code](https://github.com/jkieboom/devsummit-palm-springs-2016/tree/gh-pages/demos) from Jesse's presentation.
